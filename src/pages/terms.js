        </Section>

        <Section title="User Account Management">
        <p>Users can register using their Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, or email address. The registration and account management are facilitated by Firebase, and the Service does not offer different account types with varying levels of access or permissions.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Data Protection and Privacy">
        <p>The Service collects users' names and email addresses for account creation and management. Consent for data collection is obtained in accordance with Firebase’s protocols. For any data transfer, particularly across national borders, the Service relies on the data handling policies of Firebase, which are compliant with relevant data protection regulations.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Content Ownership and Intellectual Property">
        <p>User-generated content remains the intellectual property of the user. The Service stores this content to enable user access and use within the Service. LangFlux.space does not share, repurpose, or redistribute user-generated content without the user’s consent.</p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="User Behavior and Conduct">
          <p>
            Users are expected to use LangFlux.space responsibly and legally.

        </Section>

        <Section title="Derivative Works">

Should there be a change in subscription fees, LangFlux.space will provide at least 30 days’ notice to all active subscribers via email or a prominent notice on the service. Continued use of the Service after the fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Refund Policy">
          <p>
